# Random Password Generator

## Description

I wanted to provide a user base the option of generating a password without having to come up with one themselves. This project helped me learn about for loops and if statements, while also figuring out more about Javascript in general. This problem helps solve figuring out new passwords because we all know how much of a pain that is!
